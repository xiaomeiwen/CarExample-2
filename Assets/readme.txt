What is PUN Rally?

  PUN Rally is a complete project for a multiplayer racing game (with sources) for Unity's Asset Store. It uses PUN 
  (Photon Unity Network plugin) to access Photon's cloud based communication infrastructure for the multiplayer bits.

  The physics are set using the built in PhysX engine and stock components, controlled by a few simple scripts, and we
  decided to aim for a general simulator behavior.

What other resources exist?

  - There is an illustrated PDF Tutorial in the Assets folder to explain everything about the project structure and source code;
